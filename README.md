This is an example project for a clean architecture application. It is meant to demo how to set up various things following the clean architecture principles.

The project is split into two parts:

- backend: C# backend for the application
- frontend: SolidJs based frontend

Each part has its own README.md file with more details.


TODO:
- [ ] Implement CQRS pattern for the backend
- [ ] Add SQL Server database for the backend
- [ ] Instrument specific classes and methods for Open Telemetry
  - Can I create an attribute that can be used to instrument a class or method?
