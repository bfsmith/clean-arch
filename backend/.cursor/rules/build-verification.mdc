# Build Verification Rule

## Overview
This rule ensures that the .NET application builds successfully after any code changes. If build errors occur, they must be fixed before proceeding.

## Build Verification Process

### After Making Code Changes
1. **Always verify the build** after making changes to any C# files, project files, or configuration files
2. Run `dotnet build` in the [backend](../../../backend) directory.
3. If build errors occur, **fix them immediately** and rebuild
4. Continue fixing and rebuilding until the build succeeds with zero errors

### Build Command
- For the solution: `cd backend && dotnet build`

### Error Resolution Process
1. **Read the error message** carefully to understand the issue
2. **Fix the root cause** - don't just suppress errors
3. **Rebuild** to verify the fix
4. **Repeat** until build succeeds

### Common Build Error Categories
- **Missing using statements**: Add the appropriate `using` directive
- **Missing package references**: Add the required NuGet package to the .csproj file
- **Type mismatches**: Fix type declarations or casts
- **Namespace issues**: Verify correct namespace usage
- **Package version conflicts**: Resolve version conflicts by aligning package versions

### Important Notes
- **Never commit code** that doesn't build successfully
- **Never skip build verification** to save time
- **Always fix build errors** before moving on to other tasks
- If a build error seems complex, break it down into smaller fixes and rebuild after each change

### Build Verification Checklist
- [ ] Code changes made
- [ ] Build executed
- [ ] Build succeeded (zero errors)
- [ ] If errors occurred, they were fixed
- [ ] Build succeeded after fixes
